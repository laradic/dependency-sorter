###Breaking the Build #
#
#If any of the commands in the first four stages of the build lifecycle return a non-zero exit code, the build is broken:
#
#If before_install, install or before_script return a non-zero exit code, the build is errored and stops immediately.
#If script returns a non-zero exit code, the build is failed, but continues to run before being marked as failed.
#The exit code of after_success, after_failure, after_script and subsequent stages do not affect the build result. However, if one of these stages times out, the build is marked as a failure.


### The following default environment variables are available to all builds.
# https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/

# - CI=true
# - TRAVIS=true
# - CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION=true
# - DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
# - HAS_JOSH_K_SEAL_OF_APPROVAL=true
# - USER=travis (do not depend on this value)
# - HOME=/home/travis (do not depend on this value)
# - LANG=en_US.UTF-8
# - LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
# - RAILS_ENV=test
# - RACK_ENV=test
# - MERB_ENV=test
# - JRUBY_OPTS="--server -Dcext.enabled=false -Xcompile.invokedynamic=false"
# - JAVA_HOME is set to the appropriate value.

# Additionally, Travis CI sets environment variables you can use in your build, e.g. to tag the build, or to run post-build deployments.

# - TRAVIS_ALLOW_FAILURE: Set to true if the job is allowed to fail. false if not.
# - TRAVIS_BRANCH: For builds not triggered by a pull request this is the name of the branch currently being built; whereas for builds triggered by a pull request this is the name of the branch targeted by the pull request (in many cases this will be master).
# - TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR: The absolute path to the directory where the repository being built has been copied on the worker.
# - TRAVIS_BUILD_ID: The id of the current build that Travis CI uses internally.
# - TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER: The number of the current build (for example, “4”).
# - TRAVIS_COMMIT: The commit that the current build is testing.
# - TRAVIS_COMMIT_MESSAGE: The commit subject and body, unwrapped.
# - TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE: The range of commits that were included in the push or pull request. (Note that this is empty for builds triggered by the initial commit of a new branch.)
# - TRAVIS_EVENT_TYPE: Indicates how the build was triggered. One of push, pull_request, api, cron.
# - TRAVIS_JOB_ID: The id of the current job that Travis CI uses internally.
# - TRAVIS_JOB_NUMBER: The number of the current job (for example, “4.1”).
# - TRAVIS_OS_NAME: On multi-OS builds, this value indicates the platform the job is running on. Values are linux and osx currently, to be extended in the future.
# - TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST: The pull request number if the current job is a pull request, “false” if it’s not a pull request.
# - TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH: If the current job is a pull request, the name of the branch from which the PR originated. "" if the current job is a push build.
# - TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_SHA: If the current job is a pull request, the commit SHA of the HEAD commit of the PR. If it is a push build, "".
# - TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_SLUG: If the current job is a pull request, the slug (in the form owner_name/repo_name) of the repository from which the PR originated. If it is a push build, "".
# - TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG: The slug (in form: owner_name/repo_name) of the repository currently being built. (for example, “travis-ci/travis-build”).
# - TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS: Whether or not encrypted environment vars are being used. This value is either “true” or “false”.
# - TRAVIS_SUDO: true or false based on whether sudo is enabled.
# - TRAVIS_TEST_RESULT: is set to 0 if the build is successful and 1 if the build is broken.
# - TRAVIS_TAG: If the current build is for a git tag, this variable is set to the tag’s name.

# Language-specific builds expose additional environment variables representing the current version being used to run the build. Whether or not they’re set depends on the language you’re using.

# - TRAVIS_GO_VERSION
# - TRAVIS_HAXE_VERSION
